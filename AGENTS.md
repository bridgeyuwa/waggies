# Refactoring UI — Core Guidance

For Waggies, apply these principles within the Laravel 13 + Blade + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS v4 frontend. The current Waggies implementation and its existing tokens are the starting evidence; the project rules define the intended direction.

Apply these principles whenever a task changes the visual interface, layout, hierarchy, typography, color, imagery, responsiveness, interaction states, or design-system behavior.

## Load the right skill

- For detailed UI design or review work, load the `refactoring-ui` skill.
- For an evidence-based Waggies audit with no implementation, load `waggies-ui-audit`.
- For a bounded Waggies implementation/refactor, load `waggies-ui-refactor`.

## Foundational principles

- Start from the **feature, user task, and content priority**, not from a decorative shell.
- Separate structural decisions from polish. Solve content, hierarchy, grouping, layout, and spacing before effects and ornament.
- Work in short design/implementation cycles. Prefer the smallest coherent improvement that can be built and verified over a speculative full-site redesign.
- Never imply functionality that the product does not actually support.
- Use constrained systems for recurring choices: type, spacing, sizing, color, radius, border, shadow, opacity, and motion.
- Establish a clear primary/secondary/tertiary hierarchy. When everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized.
- Prefer de-emphasizing competing elements over continuously adding emphasis to the primary element.
- Keep semantic document structure and visual prominence separate: choose HTML for meaning/accessibility, then style it according to the intended visual hierarchy.
- Treat spacing as a relationship signal. Space inside a group must generally be smaller than space between groups.
- Give components only as much width as their content needs. Do not stretch elements merely because screen space exists.
- Do not assume everything should scale proportionally. Large elements often need to shrink faster than small elements at narrow viewports.
- Keep text readable: controlled line length, deliberate line-height, logical alignment, and a restricted type scale.
- Use color to reinforce existing meaning, never as the sole carrier of state or information.
- Use borders, shadows, backgrounds, and overlap only when they communicate separation, elevation, focus, or layering.
- Design with real media constraints. Images, icons, screenshots, avatars, and user content need intentional aspect ratios and target sizes.
- Empty, loading, error, success, disabled, hover, focus, pressed, and selected states are part of the component—not afterthoughts.

## Decision discipline

Before introducing any new visual value or pattern:

1. Inspect nearby components and the existing token system.
2. Reuse an existing token/pattern if it already solves the problem.
3. If no existing option works, explain why before adding a new token or pattern.
4. Do not create one-off values to solve local discomfort that should be addressed at the system level.

## Scope discipline

For refactors, preserve behavior unless behavior change is explicitly requested. Do not use a visual task as permission for unrelated architecture changes, dependency additions, route changes, data-model changes, or copy rewrites outside the affected experience.

=== .ai/refactoring-ui/modern-web rules ===

# Refactoring UI — Modern Web Adaptation

The source material predates several current browser, CSS, accessibility, and responsive-design practices. Preserve its design logic while implementing it with modern standards.

## Accessibility baseline

Target **WCAG 2.2 AA** for all changed UI.

- Normal text: at least 4.5:1 contrast unless a valid WCAG exception applies.
- Large text and meaningful non-text UI graphics/boundaries: at least 3:1 where required.
- Never remove visible keyboard focus. Prefer a deliberate `:focus-visible` treatment.
- Interactive controls must remain operable with keyboard and assistive technology.
- Do not encode state with color alone; pair color with text, iconography, shape, pattern, position, or another non-color cue.
- Keep accessible names, labels, descriptions, errors, and relationships intact even when visual labels are reduced or hidden.
- Do not use placeholder text as the only label.
- Avoid hover-only discovery for essential actions.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and do not make motion necessary to understand or operate the interface.
- Ensure content reflows on narrow screens and remains usable under zoom/text enlargement.
- Use adequately sized pointer targets; prefer 44px-class touch targets for primary mobile controls where practical, and never violate WCAG target-size requirements.

## Waggies implementation boundary

Use the CSS-first Tailwind v4 system in `resources/css/app.css`. Do not create `tailwind.config.js` or move public page composition into another frontend framework. Preserve Blade-first rendering, use Alpine for local interaction, and introduce Livewire only when server state materially improves the experience.

## Color model

The book recommends HSL because it maps better to human reasoning than hex/RGB. For modern CSS, prefer the project's established **OKLCH/semantic token system** when available because it is more perceptually useful for building consistent scales. Do not convert a stable project palette merely for fashion.

Use raw color values only inside the canonical token definitions in `resources/css/app.css` or a clearly required technical exception. Waggies brand primitives are documented and implemented as OKLCH there; components, guidelines, and skills should consume semantic tokens.

## Typography

- Prefer `rem`-based type tokens for scalable UI typography.
- Avoid component-relative `em` for the core type scale when it causes nested computed sizes to drift off-scale.
- `em`/`ch` remain useful for context-specific measures such as line length and component-relative spacing when the relationship is intentional.
- Do not treat exact historical pixel examples as immutable requirements; preserve the relationship and readability principle.

## Responsive layout

- Prefer intrinsic layout, `min()`, `max()`, `clamp()`, flex/grid, container queries, and explicit `max-width` constraints over percentage grids used by habit.
- Use fixed/intrinsic widths for elements that should not grow indefinitely, and flexible tracks for content that should absorb remaining space.
- Make breakpoint changes because the content needs them, not because a device name says so.

## Images

- Prefer semantic `<img>`/framework image components for content images.
- Use fixed aspect-ratio containers plus `object-fit: cover`/`contain` for unpredictable media.
- Reserve space to prevent layout shift.
- Provide appropriate `alt` text for meaningful images; use empty alt for purely decorative images.
- Supply responsive sources/sizes where the framework supports them.

## Interaction states

Every interactive pattern changed in a refactor must be checked for: default, hover (when applicable), focus-visible, pressed/active, selected/current, disabled, loading/busy, error, and success states. State styling must remain distinguishable without relying on color alone.

=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.5. You are an expert with the Laravel ecosystem. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Use `search-docs` before changes that depend on Laravel ecosystem APIs, behavior, configuration, or version-specific syntax. Skip it for copy-only edits and other changes where package documentation is irrelevant. Reuse sufficient results already in context instead of searching again.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists (settled decisions, non-obvious traps, standing constraints). Framework and package guidelines that only apply to specific paths (testing, frontend, components) also live there, under `.ai/rules/boost` — this is not just recorded decisions, it is load-bearing guidance you have not seen inline. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.
- Record a rule with `record-rule` only when the user explicitly asks for one. Instructions for the work at hand are not rules, no matter how emphatic: "remove this typo", "use X here" are work to do, not rules to record. Never record a rule on your own initiative, as a byproduct of a change, or to summarize what you just did. When the user does ask, pass a `glob` (e.g. `app/Http/Controllers/**`), a short `title`, and a few-line `note`. Use `record-rule` rather than your native memory or notes tool, because native memory is personal and session-scoped, while only `.ai/rules` is shared with the team and persists in the repo.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.
- Activate the `deploying-to-cloud` skill whenever deploying to Laravel Cloud, configuring Cloud environments or resources, using the Cloud CLI, or troubleshooting Cloud deployments.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd at `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs. Never run commands to serve the site. It is always available.
- Use the `herd` CLI to manage services, PHP versions, and sites (e.g. `herd sites`, `herd services:start <service>`, `herd php:list`). Run `herd list` to discover all available commands.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Add or update tests for behavior and logic changes when a test provides meaningful regression coverage.
- Pure copy, styling, and layout-only changes do not require new or updated tests.
- When test coverage applies, run the affected tests and ensure they pass.
- Test the changed behavior and its important failure modes, but do not add tests beyond them.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill before writing tests.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== spatie/laravel-activitylog/core rules ===

# spatie/laravel-activitylog

Activity logging package for Laravel. Logs model events and manual activities to a database table.

## Key Concepts

- **Activity**: An Eloquent model (`Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity`) storing log entries with subject, causer, event, attribute_changes, and properties.
- **Subject**: The model being acted upon (polymorphic `subject_type`/`subject_id`).
- **Causer**: The model that caused the action, typically the authenticated user (polymorphic `causer_type`/`causer_id`).
- **LogOptions**: Fluent configuration object returned by `getActivitylogOptions()` on models using the `LogsActivity` trait.
- **ActivityEvent**: Enum with cases `Created`, `Updated`, `Deleted`, `Restored`.
- **`attribute_changes`** column: stores `{"attributes": {...}, "old": {...}}` for tracked model changes.
- **`properties`** column: stores custom user data set via `withProperties()`.

## Traits

### `LogsActivity`

Add to models to automatically log create/update/delete events. Optionally implement `getActivitylogOptions()` to configure which attributes to track (defaults to logging events without attribute changes).

```php
use Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Concerns\LogsActivity;
use Spatie\Activitylog\Support\LogOptions;

class Article extends Model
{
    use LogsActivity;

    public function getActivitylogOptions(): LogOptions
    {
        return LogOptions::defaults()
            ->logFillable()
            ->logOnlyDirty()
            ->dontLogEmptyChanges();
    }
}
```

### `CausesActivity`

Add to user/causer models. Provides `activitiesAsCauser()` relationship.

### `HasActivity`

Combines `LogsActivity` and `CausesActivity`. Provides `activities()`, `activitiesAsSubject()`, and `activitiesAsCauser()`.

## Manual Logging

```php
activity()
    ->performedOn($article)
    ->causedBy($user)
    ->event(ActivityEvent::Updated)
    ->withProperties(['key' => 'value'])
    ->log('Article was updated');
```

## LogOptions Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `logFillable()` | Log all fillable attributes |
| `logAll()` | Log all attributes |
| `logOnly(array)` | Log specific attributes |
| `logExcept(array)` | Exclude attributes |
| `logOnlyDirty()` | Only log changed attributes |
| `dontLogEmptyChanges()` | Skip logging when no tracked attributes changed |
| `dontLogIfAttributesChangedOnly(array)` | Ignore updates that only change these attributes |
| `useLogName(string)` | Set custom log name |
| `setDescriptionForEvent(Closure)` | Custom description per event |
| `useAttributeRawValues(array)` | Store raw (uncast) values |

## Querying Activities

```php
use Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity;
use Spatie\Activitylog\Enums\ActivityEvent;

Activity::forEvent(ActivityEvent::Created)->get();
Activity::causedBy($user)->get();
Activity::forSubject($article)->get();
Activity::inLog('orders')->get();
```

## Setting the causer

Override the causer for a block of code:

```php
use Spatie\Activitylog\Facades\Activity;

Activity::defaultCauser($admin, function () {
    // all activities here are caused by $admin
});

// or set globally for the rest of the request
Activity::defaultCauser($admin);
```

## Disabling Logging

```php
activity()->withoutLogging(function () {
    // no activities logged here
});
```

## Accessing Changes and Properties

```php
$activity = Activity::latest()->first();

// Tracked model changes (set automatically by LogsActivity)
$activity->attribute_changes; // Collection: {"attributes": {...}, "old": {...}}

// Custom user data (set via withProperties)
$activity->properties; // Collection
$activity->getProperty('key'); // single value
```

## Custom Activity Model

Set `activity_model` in `config/activitylog.php` to a class that extends `Model` and implements `Spatie\Activitylog\Contracts\Activity`. Use a custom model for custom table names or database connections.

## Customizing Actions

The package uses action classes (`LogActivityAction`, `CleanActivityLogAction`) that can be extended and swapped via config:

```php
// config/activitylog.php
'actions' => [
    'log_activity' => \App\Actions\CustomLogActivityAction::class,
    'clean_log' => \App\Actions\CustomCleanAction::class,
],
```

Custom action classes must extend the originals. Override protected methods (`save()`, `beforeActivityLogged()`, `resolveDescription()`, etc.) to customize behavior.

## Configuration

Key config options in `config/activitylog.php`:
- `enabled`: Master on/off switch (env: `ACTIVITYLOG_ENABLED`)
- `clean_after_days`: Days to keep records for `activitylog:clean` command
- `default_log_name`: Default log name (string)
- `default_auth_driver`: Auth driver for causer resolution
- `include_soft_deleted_subjects`: Include soft-deleted subjects
- `activity_model`: Custom Activity model class
- `default_except_attributes`: Globally excluded attributes
- `actions.log_activity`: Action class for logging activities
- `actions.clean_log`: Action class for cleaning old activities

=== spatie/laravel-medialibrary/core rules ===

## Media Library

- `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` associates files with Eloquent models, with support for collections, conversions, and responsive images.
- Always activate the `medialibrary-development` skill when working with media uploads, conversions, collections, responsive images, or any code that uses the `HasMedia` interface or `InteractsWithMedia` trait.

=== spatie/boost-spatie-guidelines/core rules ===

# Project Coding Guidelines

- This codebase follows Spatie's Laravel & PHP guidelines.
- Always activate the `spatie-laravel-php-standards` skill whenever writing, editing, reviewing, or formatting Laravel or PHP code.

<!-- context7 -->
Use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation whenever the user asks about a library, framework, SDK, API, CLI tool, or cloud service — even well-known ones like React, Next.js, Prisma, Express, Tailwind, Django, or Spring Boot. This includes API syntax, configuration, version migration, library-specific debugging, setup instructions, and CLI tool usage. Use even when you think you know the answer — your training data may not reflect recent changes. Prefer this over web search for library docs.

Do not use for: refactoring, writing scripts from scratch, debugging business logic, code review, or general programming concepts.

## Steps

1. Always start with `resolve-library-id` using the library name and what to look up in the library's documentation, unless the user provides an exact library ID in `/org/project` format
2. Pick the best match (ID format: `/org/project`) by: exact name match, description relevance, code snippet count, source reputation (High/Medium preferred), and benchmark score (higher is better). If results don't look right, try alternate names or queries (e.g., "next.js" not "nextjs", or rephrase the question). Use version-specific IDs when the user mentions a version
3. `query-docs` with the selected library ID and what to look up in the library's documentation (not single words), scoped to a single concept. If the question spans multiple distinct concepts (e.g. routing and auth and caching), make a separate `query-docs` call per concept with the same library ID, unless the question is about how the concepts interact — combined queries dilute ranking and return shallow results for each topic
4. Answer using the fetched docs
